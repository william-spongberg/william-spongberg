## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

- My focus right now is developing [Duncan](https://duncan.spongberg.dev/), a PWA clone of Snapchat to avoid ads and other unnecessary junk. My goal is to eventually create a great social media template that anyone can publish to their own servers and use to create their own customised social media apps.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying a Bachelor of Science with a Major in Computing and Software Systems at the University of Melbourne in Australia. I'm set to graduate June 2025.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything fun and progressive! I'm always looking to be better today than I was yesterday, however that might be.
