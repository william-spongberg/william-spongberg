## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

- ![PTV Inspector Tracker](https://ptv.spongberg.dev/_next/image?url=%2Ficon.png&w=32&q=75) My focus right now is developing [TransitEye](https://github.com/william-spongberg/transit-eye), a website focused on allowing users to report and locate PTV inspectors in real-time.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying a **Bachelor of Science** with a Major in Computing and Software Systems at the **University of Melbourne** in Australia. I'm set to graduate **June 2025**.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything **fun** and **progressive**! I'm always looking to **be better today than I was yesterday**, however that might be.
