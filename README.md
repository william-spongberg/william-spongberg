## Hi there! 👋

- 🌱 I’m currently studying a **Bachelor of Science** with a Major in Computing and Software Systems at the **University of Melbourne** in Australia. I'm set to graduate **June 2025**.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on anything **fun** and **progressive**! I'm always looking to **be better today than I was yesterday**, however that might be.
- 💬 Ask me about **Deno** and **Fresh**, loving web development right now due to how responsive, customisable and highly accessible it is with all devices :)
