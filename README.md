## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [nothofagus](https://github.com/william-spongberg/nothofagus), a **proof-of-concept social media app** with r/place-style user interaction.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying a **Bachelor of Science** with a Major in Computing and Software Systems at the **University of Melbourne** in Australia. I'm set to graduate **June 2025**.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything **fun** and **progressive**! I'm always looking to **be better today than I was yesterday**, however that might be.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about **Deno** and **Fresh**, loving web development right now due to how responsive, customisable and compatible it is with all devices :)
